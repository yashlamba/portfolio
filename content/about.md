Hi, here's a little about me.

Namaskar! üôè

I am Yash, a software engineer at CERN. I am passionate about building software, teaching, interacting with people and learning new things. With
the power of code, I try to make fun and useful things.

Most of my exerience has been working on backend systems. I have built end-to-end AI/ML systems, scalable web applications and worked on creative bio-tech and computer vision projects. I am currently improving my skills in software design, databases and AI.

I have a keen interest in education. I teach mathematics and computer science to school/university folks when possible.

Apart from work, I mostly spend my time [exploring](/explore).
