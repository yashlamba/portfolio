Hi, here's a little about me.

---

I am a full-stack developer, currently building/breaking/fixing stuff at HackerRank. I have worked with a lot of technologies and am quite fast in learning new things as well. Currently, I am figuring out backend architecture, design, infra scaling and cloud. I have also tinkered with ML/AI (can get a lot of things working) but am not actively improving myself in those.

I always find myself in situations where I know the most complicated stuff but end up Googling the simplest things (like how to read csv hehe). I can learn new stuff fairly quickly and build amazing things with it! You can find most of my builds on [GitHub](https://github.com/yashlamba).

Apart from development, I have a passion for teaching mathematics and computer science which I try to do as much as possible whenever I get a chance. I love to watch lectures and have completed over 10 MOOCs from [MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/) (Thank you, MIT).

I like to read both fiction and non-fiction. Pandemic got me interested in plants and I have been studying more about botany since!
