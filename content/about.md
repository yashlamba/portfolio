Hi, here's a little about me.

---

I am a software engineer currently working at CERN. I've worked on multiple projects and am fast at learning new things. Currently, I am getting better at software architecture, databases and cloud. I have also worked on building production ready ML/AI systems.

I always find myself in situations where I know the most complicated stuff but end up Googling the simplest things (like how to read csv hehe). I can learn new stuff fairly quickly and build amazing things with it! You can find most of my builds on [GitHub](https://github.com/yashlamba).

Apart from software, I have an active interest in education. I teach mathematics and computer science as much as possible. I love to watch lectures and am always learning new things.

I like to read, cook and travel. Pandemic spiked my interest in plants, and I have been studying more about botany since!
