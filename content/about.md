Hi, here's a little about me.

### Interests

I am a full-stack developer experienced with multiple tech stacks and am quite interested in backend architecture, design, scaling and cloud. I personally believe that good programmers
are never limited by the tech stacks they have in memory but how well they can understand, learn and develop new things! I always find myself in situations where I know the most complicated stuff but end up Googling the simplest things and that is how development works. I can learn new stuff fairly quickly and build amazing things with it!

Apart from development, I have a passion for teaching mathematics and computer science which I try to do as much as possible whenever I get a chance.

I like to read both fiction and non-fiction. Pandemic got me interested in plants and I have been studying more about botany since!
